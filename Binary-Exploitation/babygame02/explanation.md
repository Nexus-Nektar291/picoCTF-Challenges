## 🕹️ Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 🔹 Step 1:
Set the `player_title` character to the **last byte of the `win()` function's return address** using the `l` command.

### 🔹 Step 2:
Move the player to the **target position on the x-axis**, starting from position `4`.

### 🔹 Step 3:
Move the player on the **y-axis**, starting from position `4`, and **underflow** the position to reach `y_pos = -1`.

This results in a control flow redirection, allowing the execution of the `win()` function and revealing the flag.
