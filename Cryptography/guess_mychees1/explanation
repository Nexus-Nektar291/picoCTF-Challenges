We’re given an encrypted string and a cryptic hint:

“Remember that cipher we devised together Squeexy? The one that incorporates your affinity for linear equations???”

The hint strongly points toward the Affine Cipher, which is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher based on a linear transformation over modular arithmetic.

The encryption formula for the Affine cipher is:

𝐸(𝑥)=(𝑎⋅𝑥 + 𝑏) mod 26

Where:

x is the position of the plaintext letter (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25),

a and b are keys,

a must be coprime with 26.

🔍 Initial Test
We were told to encrypt a known cheese, and I chose:

Plaintext: CHEDDAR
The program responded with:
Ciphertext: GBEFFIR

🔓 Cracking the Cipher
To recover the encryption keys, I used dcode.fr, a well-known cipher analysis tool.
By providing the plaintext-ciphertext pair:

Plaintext: CHEDDAR
Ciphertext: GBEFFIR

The site successfully identified the Affine Cipher keys:
a = 25
b = 8

🧠 Decrypting the Main Challenge
The encrypted cheese given in the challenge was:

Ciphertext: CIHRAEXGWA
Using the identified key pair (a = 25, b = 8), I decrypted this using the same dcode tool and got:

Decrypted: GABRIELCMI

🏁 Final Step:

Submit the decrypted text, And… 🎉 Flag Captured!
